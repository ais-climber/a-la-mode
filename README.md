# Neural Semantics
A neuro-symbolic interface, intended for both **model extraction** (extracting knowledge from a net) as well as **model building** (building a net from a knowledge base).  The name comes from the core idea -- that the internal dynamics of neural networks can be used as formal semantics of knowledge bases.

## :heavy_check_mark: Supported Features:
- Model extraction
- Countermodel generation (via a random search, no construction yet)
- Inferring what the net has learned before and after learning

## ‚ùó Current Limitations:
- Nets must be feed-forward, with a binary step activation function
- Nets currently must be hand-crafted
- Nets must be used for classification tasks in discrete domains
- Nets learn via (unsupervised) Hebbian learning
- Knowledge bases are expressed in a certain restricted modal syntax (see below)

## üìù Planned Features
- Model building
- Counter-model building
- Proper sigmoid activation functions
- Plug-and-play with your existing Tensorflow model
- Tasks beyond classification
- Learning via backpropagation (!)
- Predicate/quantifier reasoning

# :brain: The Translation
( so sentences in a knowledge base correspond to the dynamics of the net)

What drives our program is the idea that neural networks can be used as formal semantics of knowledge bases.  If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend starting with:
